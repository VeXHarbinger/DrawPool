# DrawPool
## An HDT Plugin, to help clear-up your minion draw pool possibilities.
This is a plug-in for the [Hearthstone Deck Tracker](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker).
Currently, it shows you the possible cards that could be drawn from your hand with the [Elven Minstrel](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Elven_Minstrel) or the [Witchwood Piper](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Witchwood_Piper).

This, of course, only predicts the known deck cards.

I hope to add in the mechanics for [Recruit](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Recruit) soon.
