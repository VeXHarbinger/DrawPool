# Drawpool

## An HDT Plugin, to help clear-up your minion draw pool possibilities.

This is a plug-in for the [Hearthstone Deck Tracker](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker).
Currently, it shows you the possible cards that could be drawn from your hand with the [Elven Minstrel](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Elven_Minstrel) or the [Witchwood Piper](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Witchwood_Piper).
I hope to add in the mechanics for [Recruit](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Recruit) soon.

## What this does

![Display Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VeXHarbinger/DrawPool/master/images/DisplaySample.png)

* In the lower left hand corner you see the draw probability for a card that you have one or two copies of.

* If you have one (or more) copies of a card, it will also display the card draw percentage for the card you have the most copies of.

* In the lower right hand corner, it shows the number of Minions are in the total deck card count.

## Configuration
You can set where the window is displayed when the player hand hovers over the trigger card from the Options => Plug-in menu
